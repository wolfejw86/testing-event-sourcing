# @servicebus/rabbitbus-model-service-template
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/servicebus/rabbitbus-model-service-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/servicebus/rabbitbus-model-service-template)

This is an example of a "model" microservice using `@servicebus/rabbitbus`, because model services are the most complex, and most necessary :)

It uses Event Sourcing with `sourced`.

This model service doesn't need an HTTP API, to see an example of using servicebus
with an API, check out: https://github.com/patrickleet/servicebus-api-template

## Explore the Code

`./bin/start.mjs`
* Starts the application:
  1. Connects to DB
  1. Configures a bus
  1. Registers command/event handlers with `servicebus-register-handlers`
* If you find the "common" settings don't work for you, it's easy to use your own!

`./handlers/*`
* Event and command handlers
  * Events are "published" with `bus.publish`, and services can `subscribe` to those events
  * Commands are "sent" with `bus.send`, and services can `listen` for those commands
* Imported/Required by `servicebus-register-handlers` when the service starts

`./config.mjs`
* Using `cconfig` for configuration
  * A "cascading configuration" tool
  * env variables are applied on top of default config
  * can configure environment specific configs as well

That's it! The rest is tooling.
